To achieve this, we train a machine learning model using labeled samples. Based on this learning, the machine learning model can divide datasets into different classes. The best example to better understand classification is filtering emails into two categories: spam and non-spam.\n",

For instance, in predicting house prices, we can use information from other houses to estimate the price of a specific house. Features such as area size, number of rooms, presence or absence of parking or a yard, and other influential factors on house prices can be used as input information to the algorithm.\n",

    "- The difference in this type of learning compared to supervised learning lies solely in the absence of labels. In other words, there is no supervisor (labels) telling the child (computer) when it has made the right prediction and when it has made a mistake. In this learning approach, the model must find hidden patterns autonomously and without the help of labels, which are commonly used in supervised learning.<br>\n",

    "- In machine learning, a model is like a mathematical algorithm or a set of rules that a computer uses to make predictions or decisions based on data it has been trained on. Imagine it as a virtual brain that learns from examples and then uses that knowledge to solve specific problems.\n",
    "- Think of a model as a recipe for making a cake. The recipe tells you the exact steps to follow, such as what ingredients to mix, how long to bake it, and at what temperature. Similarly, a machine learning model is designed to follow specific rules based on the data it has seen during training.\n",
    "- During training, the model is presented with a large dataset that contains examples of inputs (like features of the cake) and their corresponding outputs (like the final taste of the cake). It learns from these examples, adjusting its internal parameters, just like a baker might learn from experience to improve the cake's taste.\n",
    "- Once the model has learned from the data, it can be used to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data. This is similar to using the trained cake recipe to bake a new cake with slightly different ingredients. The model's goal is to provide accurate predictions or make decisions based on the patterns it has learned from the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ›‘ **Learning Evaluation | Training and Test Data ->**\n",
    "- Now we became familiar with various supervised learning methods. However, how can we be sure that a model performs well on new data? Let's assume that for an exam, you have access to a set of sample questions from previous exams, and by studying them, you become proficient in answering all the questions in this sample. However, your true learning level is not determined based on your accuracy in answering questions for which you already know the answers; instead, it is determined by your final exam score, which reflects your overall understanding.\n",
    "- Similarly, to evaluate the performance of a trained model (or, in other words, its performance metric \"p\"), we need to test its answers on new data. Just like in an exam, where you might excel in some questions and not in others, using a single question to assess your learning level would be inaccurate. Therefore, the best approach is to use a large number of diverse questions and then calculate the model's accuracy on all of them. For this reason, some data is set aside for evaluation purposes, while the rest is used for training the model. The data used for training is called the training data, and the data used for evaluation is called the test data.\n",
    "- Note: The term \"p\" here refers to the performance metric or evaluation measure used for the model. It could be accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc., depending on the problem and the evaluation needs.\n",
